Azure Data Factory
--A fully managed, serverless data integration solution for ingesting, 
preparing and transforming all of your data at scale.

Data Problem:

Data Sources ---- Ingest ---  Transform/Analyse --- Publish  --- Data Consumers

Azure Data Factory is not:

Data Migration Tool
Data Streaming Service
Suitable for Complex Data Transformations
Data Storage Service

Mortality
Hospitalization/ ICU Cases
Testing Number

=========================

Data Warehouse to be built with the following data 
to aid Reporting on Trends
Confirmed cases
Mortality
Hospitalization/ ICU Case

Storage Solutions
=================

***Key Factors to consider while deciding storage solutions by Data Engineers:

Structure of the data



How often is the data accessed?
How quickly do we need to serve?
Need to run simple queries? 
Need to run heavy analytical workload
Access from multiple regions?


Azure Databases
================
Azure SQL Database
Azure Database for MySQL
Azure Database for PostgreSQL
VM Images with Oracle, SQL Server etc
Azure Database for MariaDB


Azure Storage Account
====================
Blob Storage
File Storage
Disk Storage
Table Storage
Queue Storage


Azure Data Lake
====================
